# _{Address Book}_

##### _{Store Contact Names, Phone Numbers, and Addresses}, {August 7, 2015}_

#### By _**{Chris Lytsell}**_

## Description

_{Address Book will take a user's contact information and store it in a nicely formatted address book. Address Book will store user supplied contact names, phone numbers, and addresses. All contacts will be displayed on the home page. The Address Book home page will provide the user with the input form to add a new contact, as well as an option to clear out the address book. User will get a confirmation notification when the address book is cleared, and, in the case where the address book is not cleared for some reason, an error page will alert the user of lingering contacts in the address book.}_

## Setup

_{TO MY EPICODUS INSTRUCTORS: I am very unclear what the setup section should include. Do I list the composer stuff? Do I tell all the steps I took to get the thing to work? (Install PHP on my computer, install Composer on my computer, etc.) I guess overall I am unclear on how to take these files I am writing and make them work anywhere. Can someone just copy all these files and throw them on a server, and they work? This is the part of programming - the actual implementation of the program files - that I never quite understood. :-\ }_

* _This is a great place_
* _to list setup instructions_
* _in a simple_
* _easy-to-understand_
* _format_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Are there other applications this app depends on?}_

## Technologies Used

_{PHP, Twig, Silex, Bootstrap}_
